Romans 8:28

> And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.

And we know that all things work together for the good…  
This verse has been a comfort of mine as of late. It is a subtle reminder that God is sovereign, kind, loving, and good.

The verse tells us that for those who love God and are called according to His purpose, everything will be alright.

We can also couple this verse with **Jeremiah 29:11**, that says:

> For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the LORD, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.

Reading these two verses together might tempt one into falling into the trap of the prosperity gospel. The prosperity gospel teaches us that God only wants us to prosper. And as much as I believe this is true, the kind of prosperity God wants for us isn’t necessarily the kind of prosperity we’d prioritize for ourselves. The prosperity gospel often speaks of financial prospering, and not so much spiritual. It is a shortcut to receiving the gifts of God without having a relationship with God. It is an insidious thing, the prosperity gospel, it reduces God to being nothing but a sugar daddy, and not a father.

As much as God wants us to prosper in the physical, more than that He wants us to prosper in the spiritual. He wants us to prosper in our relationship with Him and our closeness to Him. God is the prize, not that new Mercedes. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?

This verse is a reminder that everything will be okay. And that doesn’t necessarily mean that things will end up the way we want them to, but it does mean that everything will be okay.

It doesn’t mean that you’ll get into that university you’ve always wanted. It doesn’t mean your mom will beat the cancer. It doesn’t mean that you’ll get a spouse before you turn 35. It just means that despite all that may or may not happen, you are still invited to partake in the joy of the Lord, the peace that He gives us, and the love that He has for us. So, take heart. Your story will have a happy ending. Remember that when you're feeling defeated.

Vienna waits for you.
