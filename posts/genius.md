When asked if he was a genius, Thomas Edison responded:

> "You know well enough I am nothing of the sort, unless we accept the theory that genius is prolonged patience. I am patient enough to be sure."

Sometimes genius looks like something out of this world, and sometimes it very well is. But most of the time it's nothing but time under tension. If you train hard enough for long enough eventually you will become a master.

And that really is all there is to it. It's not complicated. Put your head down, get better, and be patient. Trust me. You'll surprise yourself.

Vienna waits for you.
